## Overview

The objective of project is to help the users identify the traiffic sign and create awareness about the traffic signs.

## Features

- Accurate Prediction:Highlight the model's ability to accurately detect and classify various types of traffic signs, including common and less common variants.

- Real-Time Detection:plement real-time detection capabilities, demonstrating the system's ability to process and classify traffic signs in live video streams or camera feeds.

- User-Friendly Interface:Develop a clear and intuitive user interface using Flask, allowing users to upload images, view detection results, and interact with the system easily.

- Traffic Sign Localization:Include the ability to localize detected traffic signs within images or frames, providing bounding boxes or regions of interest for each detected sign.
